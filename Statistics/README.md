# Important mathematical functions and distributions you should be aware of:

***1. Gradient descent:***
   This is crucial for optimizing machine learning models. This optimisation algorithm is used in machine learning to minimize the cost or loss function. It is essential in algorithms such as regression models and neural networks. It is a 1st order iterative algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable multivariate function.
   
   The concept in brief is the following:
   
   Take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the function at the current point, because it the the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent. 

   Gradient descent is not the same as the local search algorithm, even though both are iterative methods for optimization.
