# Roadmap to learn SQL for Data science career

## Why Learn SQL for a Data Science Career?
Learning SQL is crucial for a career in data science, especially when working in different industries. While downloading or loading data is a starting point, it is not sufficient for handling the complex tasks required in a data science job.

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It enables data scientists to efficiently retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data stored in databases. This is essential for industries like finance, healthcare, retail, and technology, where vast amounts of structured data are generated daily.

In a professional setting, data scientists need to perform various operations such as filtering large datasets, joining tables, aggregating results, and creating complex queries to derive meaningful insights. These tasks go beyond simply loading data; they require the ability to manipulate data directly within the database.

Moreover, SQL skills are critical for cleaning and preprocessing data, which are fundamental steps in the data analysis process. Clean data is crucial for building accurate predictive models and performing robust analyses. Without SQL, data scientists would struggle to handle messy and unstructured data effectively.

Having strong SQL skills is also vital for passing job interviews in data science. Many technical interviews include SQL-based questions to assess a candidate's ability to work with databases. Employers look for candidates who can write efficient queries, optimize database performance, and solve real-world data problems.



## 1. Understand the Basics

### 1.1. What is SQL?

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a standard language specifically designed for accessing and manipulating databases. It plays a crucial role in retrieving and managing data stored in relational databases, which are widely used in various fields, including data science. SQL enables data scientists and analysts to efficiently query large datasets, perform data manipulations, and manage database structures, making it an indispensable tool for data-driven decision-making and analysis.
