# Roadmap to learn SQL for Data science career

## Why Learn SQL for a Data Science Career?
Learning SQL is crucial for a career in data science, especially when working in different industries. While downloading or loading data is a starting point, it is not sufficient for handling the complex tasks required in a data science job.

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It enables data scientists to efficiently retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data stored in databases. This is essential for industries like finance, healthcare, retail, and technology, where vast amounts of structured data are generated daily.

In a professional setting, data scientists need to perform various operations such as filtering large datasets, joining tables, aggregating results, and creating complex queries to derive meaningful insights. These tasks go beyond simply loading data; they require the ability to manipulate data directly within the database.

Moreover, SQL skills are critical for cleaning and preprocessing data, which are fundamental steps in the data analysis process. Clean data is crucial for building accurate predictive models and performing robust analyses. Without SQL, data scientists would struggle to handle messy and unstructured data effectively.

Having strong SQL skills is also vital for passing job interviews in data science. Many technical interviews include SQL-based questions to assess a candidate's ability to work with databases. Employers look for candidates who can write efficient queries, optimize database performance, and solve real-world data problems.


### **1. Understand the Basics**

#### **1.1. What is SQL?**
SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. It's essential for retrieving and managing data stored in relational databases, which are commonly used in data science.

#### **1.2. Key Concepts**
- **Database**: A collection of organized data.
- **Table**: A collection of related data entries consisting of rows and columns.
- **Row**: A single record in a table.
- **Column**: A set of data values of a particular type in a table.

### **2. Core SQL Syntax and Commands**

#### **2.1. Data Retrieval**
- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
- **FROM**: Specify the table(s) to query data from.
- **WHERE**: Filter records based on specific conditions.
- **ORDER BY**: Sort the results.

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' ORDER BY last_name;
```

#### SELECT Statement

The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It is one of the most commonly used SQL commands.

#### Example Table: Employees

| ID  | Name       | Department | Salary |
|-----|------------|------------|--------|
| 1   | John Doe   | Sales      | 60000  |
| 2   | Jane Smith | HR         | 65000  |
| 3   | Mike Brown | IT         | 70000  |
| 4   | Lisa White | Marketing  | 62000  |

#### Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

### Example Command
To retrieve all columns from the Employees table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```
| ID  | Name       | Department | Salary |
|-----|------------|------------|--------|
| 1   | John Doe   | Sales      | 60000  |
| 2   | Jane Smith | HR         | 65000  |
| 3   | Mike Brown | IT         | 70000  |
| 4   | Lisa White | Marketing  | 62000  |




#### WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records that meet certain conditions.

#### Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
### Example Command
To retrieve employees from the Sales department:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales';

```








#### **2.2. Data Manipulation**
- **INSERT INTO**: Add new records to a table.
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing records.
- **DELETE**: Remove records from a table.

Example:
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'HR');
```

#### **2.3. Aggregation and Grouping**
- **COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN**: Perform calculations on data.
- **GROUP BY**: Group rows sharing a property so that an aggregate function can be applied.

Example:
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as num_employees FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```

### **3. Advanced SQL Concepts**

#### **3.1. Joins**
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records with matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN**: Returns records when there is a match in either table.

Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

#### **3.2. Subqueries**
A query nested inside another query.

Example:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```

#### **3.3. Indexes**
Enhance the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.

Example:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_department ON employees(department_id);
```

### **4. SQL for Data Analysis**

#### **4.1. Window Functions**
Perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.

Example:
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
FROM employees;
```

#### **4.2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
Simplify complex queries with temporary result sets.

Example:
```sql
WITH department_sales AS (
    SELECT department_id, SUM(sales) as total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT departments.department_name, department_sales.total_sales
FROM departments
JOIN department_sales ON departments.id = department_sales.department_id;
```

### **5. Practical Application**

#### **5.1. Practice with Real Datasets**
Utilize platforms like Kaggle or SQLZoo to practice your SQL skills with real-world datasets.

#### **5.2. Projects**
Work on data science projects that require data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) using SQL.

### **6. Optimization and Performance Tuning**

#### **6.1. Query Optimization**
Learn to write efficient SQL queries that minimize execution time and resource consumption.

#### **6.2. Database Design**
Understand normalization and denormalization, and how to design databases for optimal performance.

### **7. Continuous Learning and Resources**

#### **7.1. Online Courses and Tutorials**
Enroll in courses on platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and DataCamp to deepen your SQL knowledge.

#### **7.2. Documentation and Books**
